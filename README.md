# superman

Direct jump to argument part when read man/info/bash man. Fly like a superman :p

How to use:  

[1]  Source it first, or normally put its code in ~/.bash_aliases  

$ chmod +x superman.sh; . superman.sh  

[2]
- Run as `superman -i gcc Werror` (-i means case insensitive), OR `superinfo g++ c` OR `bashman history`.  Don't put hyphen, e.g. -Werror will skip some results if that option no hyphen
- press 'N' OR <Shift+N> key to navigate.  
- bashman means read shell builtin.  
- enjoy :)
